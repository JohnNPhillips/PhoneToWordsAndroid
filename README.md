Phone to Words is a simple Android app that converts phone numbers (or any other arbitrary digits) into their alphabetic representations. For instance, it can convert 74663686237 to "Phone-Number", "Shone-Ounces", "Pin-Me-Ounces", or a hundred other things. To do this, it utilizes the [PhoneToWordsJava classes](https://github.com/AyrosProjects/PhoneToWordsJava) which are developed separately.
